*I made it myself, so not too rich in functions/futures, but i thinked maybe can help other(s) too if i publish it.*

This app help you tracking your smoking habits and reduce the dose greatly and prepare you to the "freedom day" (quitting).
How?
The app is a game pack in the game also.

The motivation/distraction system is add to you more help to push out the breaktime (time between two smoke) more and more.

If you fulfill the setted breaktime, you got expirence points (xp) and levelup like an RPG game. In the 'Rewards' menu open 1 flash game for each earned level.
The max level is 50.
When you overfulfill the time got bonus xp, but if you underperforming then you lose xp.


## Tips

First of all try still your dose with lighter cigaretes. If you smoke 20 normal cigarettes per day, change to light and stay on 20 dialy.

When you can hold the dose with light, start lower the dose. Use the timer to push out the next times when you smoke.

Try lower your dose to minimum 8-10 or better 5-6 light cigarette per day while you reach level 50.

The lowered dose makes easier for you the finaly free from the smoking. The day when you left over the smoking is the freedom day.

If you fall back more the 1-2 cigarette per day, you can restart the procedure with your lower dose. Use the "Reset profile" menu.

You can delete game saves also with the "Reset games" menu button.
